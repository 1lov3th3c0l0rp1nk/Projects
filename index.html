    <h1>Social Equality</h1>
    <div> 
    <pre>
    The problem with society 
    is that people see what 
    the skin color is first
    and judge based from that.

    <div>
    <pre>
    Society tends to judge people 
    based on color and not how 
    the person actually is. They
    see skin color as the one thing that
    defines who someone is.
    </pre>

    <div>
    <pre>
    When people see that someone is
    a different color then them, 
    they believe that person is 
    beneath them.
    </pre>

    <p>People should not have to fight because of the color of their skin</p>

    <h1>Solutions</h1>
    <h2>Here are a few solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Educating and Rising awareness</li>
        <pre>
        We can help people find the courage to
        speak against things that discriminate
        against certain people.
        </pre>

        <li>Understanding that you view race as a problem</li>
        <pre>
        When people understand that they see
        color first instead of who the person
        is, helps them understand that they 
        are the problem and possibly get help.
        </pre>

        <li>Calling out people who are being Racist</li>
        <pre>
        When people don't get called out for 
        what they say or do they will feel
        like they did nothing wrong and 
        will continue to do what they do.
        Calling them out will let them know 
        that what they say or do will not be 
        tolerated.
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <p>We should be able to live together and be untied in what we want for us.</p>
